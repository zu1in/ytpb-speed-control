# ytpb-speed-control
This extension allows you to change video playback speed in YouTube html5 players.

### Synopsis

This widget started as a quick attemp to fix my struggle with switching speed of YouTube player. Eventually I made it a little nicer while trying to learn more about Chrome Ext development. You can use it if you like it but if you're really into productivity and great tools I encourage you to check out [HTML5 video speed controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed) by [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik). It's much more flexible and supports **all html5 videos** not just YouTube ones.
